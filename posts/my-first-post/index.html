Project planning

Mistake #1 - not realizing the scope of the project and always planning short term
It depends on your personality but if you are a perfectionist, projects are a trap. Scope creep is real, and because it&rsquo;s your house, you don&rsquo;t want to cut corners as you&rsquo;ll be spending the rest of your life there."><meta name=author content="Me"><link rel=canonical href=http://localhost:1313/posts/my-first-post/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=http://localhost:1313/posts/my-first-post/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:1313/posts/my-first-post/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="My New Hugo Site"><meta property="og:title" content="Lessons when renovating a house"><meta property="og:description" content="Me an my wife renovated a house from late 1970s in 2020s.

We were young and made mistakes despite trying hard not to. Here’s how and why and what lessons can be learned.\nProject planning Mistake #1 - not realizing the scope of the project and always planning short term It depends on your personality but if you are a perfectionist, projects are a trap. Scope creep is real, and because it’s your house, you don’t want to cut corners as you’ll be spending the rest of your life there.\nWe didn’t want to limit the scope. We wanted to do it on a mid-sized budget, not spending too much for management costs (therefore not hiring companies) We didn’t get enough of a bank loan and the covid hit right when we started so I also lost most of my income as a software consultant as companies were tightening their budgets We were always in a hurry to get contractors, meaning we ended up with a bad negotiation position We had non-standard requirements for most of the work and the contractors didn’t want to risk anything new and when they did, they sometimes screw up. They also screwed up things they did regularly so there’s that. Mistake #2 - trusting in “experts” This one is difficult. Because you can’t understand everything before you start. You should however learn enough to be able to detect BS contractors. I mean contractors that do not know their craft sufficiently.\nMistake #3 - Not being lucky You really have to be lucky, there is no other way to do it. When your success depends on other people, you may change the way you find them, talk to them, check on them, pay them, etc. But just getting the right person at the right time in the right location is a matter of luck on such a small scale. If you were building houses professionally then statistically you can have great odds with your skill but if it’s one and done for you, you’re not likely to acquire the skills soon enough to apply them, so it’s more about luck than anything.\nAt the end of the project we could smell the bad contractors with a higher dependabilty, but there is such a variation of bad qualities of contractors, so many bad types that you can’t possibly learn to detect all of them unless this is your job.\nLet’s keep in mind that you can get the job done with a bad contractor too. And sometimes you’ll have to. Sometimes they will steal from you, make a poor job or make you pay twice for something and you might not even notice so you don’t feel you’re being screwed by them (intentionally or not). The more detail oriented you are, the worse it is for you because you will notice and it will bother you. So you will become the bad customer, the one that is making trouble, who wants the walls to be straight, contracts to be honored and expenses to match reality.\n","wordCount":"509","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-02-23T17:47:18+01:00","dateModified":"2025-02-23T17:47:18+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-first-post/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"My New Hugo Site","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Lessons when renovating a house</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-02-23 17:47:18 +0100 CET'>February 23, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;509 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Me&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/my-first-post.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Me an my wife renovated a house from late 1970s in 2020s.
